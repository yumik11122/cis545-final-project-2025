# CIS 545 Final Project (Spring 2025) – Global Health Inequality Analysis

## Overview
This project investigates the relationship between GDP per capita and infant mortality using global economic and health data provided by the World Bank and Kaggle.  
Using data from **258 countries and regions** across **over 50 years (1960–2015)**, we apply machine learning models to predict countries at high risk of infant mortality (≥ 40 deaths per 1,000 live births), based solely on GDP per capita.
